## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Please see the chart below of the analysis that was performeed using linear regression formula to predict MPG. The chart shows how each variable affects the MPG of a car.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Please see the 2 charts below showing the final analysis of the summary statistics on the suspension. Lots 1 and 2 meet the variance requirement to be under 100. Lot 3 seem to be higher with a variance of 170.

## T-Test of Suspension Coils

In the result example below you will notice that lot 1 and lot 2 did not show a big difference in PSI. In lot there there was a bigger difference.

## Study Design: MechaCar VS Competiton

A few things to consider that I feel would be important to the consumer is the cost, maintenance cost and the safety rating. Most consumers would appreciate having more bang for there buck.

What metrics or metrics are you going to test? 
* The best way to measure the metrics is to compare the cost of MechaCar's against other comparable cars to see which prices are better and which has a higher safety rating, and lower maintenance fee's. Taking data from the last 5 years to compare from Makes such as Ford, Hyundai, Toyota etc, will help trmendously with testing the metricsof MechaCar's against the competition.

What is the Null Hypothesis or the Alternative Hypothesis?
* The null hypothesis is that it may not make much of a difference in the price or the maintenance cost or safteing ratings.
* The alternative hypothesis is that MechaCar's prices, maintenance fees, and safety ratings could be much better. I believe that could drive up sales for MechaCars.

What Statistcal test would you use to test the hypothesis? And Why?
* I would use multiple linear regression becasuse it will show how much variance in the dependent variable for in a linear combination of independent variable.

What data is needed to run the statistical test?
* A complete dataset of all competitors car prices, maintenance cost and reports as well as safety rating reports. Theat data would help me to analyze and compare MechaCar data against the competitors data.
